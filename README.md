Using OPTCS to create a density reachability diagram 

# Case description
Use OPTICS to create a density reachability diagram for minP ts = 6. Extract a clustering for each reachability-dist = {1, 1.5, . . . , 5}
and display the result in a scatter plot, respectively. Highlight cluster assignments and noise
points in color. Evaluate the change of the clustering result with increasing threshold for
reachability-dist regarding the number of clusters as well as the number of core, border, and
noise points.
